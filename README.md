# Domain Name Generator .py 
 - Scripts to generate permutations of Domain names that could be used for Typosquatting.
 - Usage: change the company variable name within the file.
 
### Future Considerations:
 - This script could be tied to an API to assess if these Domains are available, and evaluate a heuristic "trustworthiness score" against a cost matrix to optimize the purchase of your domains. 

# RTLO and LTRO Generator
 - Insert a filename, and the file extension you would like to spoof.
 - Filenames can be copied and pasted into the filename field of a file. 
 
# SubdomainConverter
 - Converts domain names to subdomains. 
 - Insert valid "long FQDN with a long URL path (and parameters?) and your domain name. 
### Future Considerations:
 - Implement checks for length, and subdivisions.
